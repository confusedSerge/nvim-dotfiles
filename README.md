# Neovim Dotfiles

![Screenshot](/other/screenshot.png)

Hey there! This is my personal neovim configuration. I use it for all my programming needs. It's a work in progress, so it's not perfect yet, especially, as I am still learning how to set up neovim properly and how to use it efficiently.

## Installation

Depending on your setup, you might not want to install this repository directly into your configuration directory. I personally like to keep my dotfiles in a separate directory and use rsync to copy them to the configuration directory. This way I can keep track of my dotfiles with git and still have them in the right place. Most likely in your case, you will clone this into a different directory and cherry-pick the files you want to use. 

### Prerequisites

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

## Color Scheme and Icons

The color scheme I use is a variation of some linux rice I found a while back and modified it to my liking. Sadly, I do not recall where I found it nor have any surviving links to it. If you know where it came from, please let me know so I can give proper credit, as I really enjoy this color scheme and been using it for a while now.
